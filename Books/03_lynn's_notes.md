* FREE Tools:

www.tikr.com for all data from Quarterly statements. It's a front-end for S&P Global Capital IQ. Best resource I've found for Quarterly and Annual statement data -- Includes Cash Flow per Share (couldn't find anywhere else). PM for an invite code.

www.tradingview.com for all charting. They offer paid subscription plans, but the free plan is enough to identify bases.

www.finviz.com for all news aggregating and as pinned to this subreddit, a decent stock screener. Not necessary to pay for a subscription.

Semi-Free Tools:

www.whalewisdom.com for digging into institutional buyers. A paid subscription is required to see institutional buying prior to the last quarter. This is kind of important and worth the fee $25/month.

https://finbox.com/screener Better screener than finviz because you can layer the same metrics. free version offers you a basic screener, but the paid subscription opens up "paid metrics". Worth the $10/month.

All these tools combined with an IBD Digital subscription is more than enough to use the CANSLIM system without paying $150 for MarketSmith.

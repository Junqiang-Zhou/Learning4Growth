## How I Made $2M In the Stock Market
### What NOT TODO:
    - Buy what I was told to buy
    - You cannot go broke taking a profit
    - Buy cheap, sell dear

### What TODO:
    - I should rather hold onto one rising stock for a longer period than juggle with a dozen stocks for a short period at a time.
